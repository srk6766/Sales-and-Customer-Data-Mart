Project on a data mart for Sales and Customer data, optimizing query performance and efficiency on a Google Big Query project. 
Using Google Looker Studio, I applied sophisticated SQL techniques for data processing task optimization and conducted detailed data structuring to optimize the database schema.
I hugely improved data retrieval speed and reliability, hence overall amplifying the performance of data analytics processes, through fine-tuning complex queries and restructuring datasets.
